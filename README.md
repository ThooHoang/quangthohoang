# 🌐 My Portfolio

## 📄 Overview

This is my first personal **portfolio**, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s the project I’ve focused on the most so far – I really dove into it, enjoyed working on it, and learned a lot along the way.  

Even though I’m still at the beginning of my journey, this portfolio represents my motivation and the way I create.  

## 🚀 Features & Design

- Minimalistic yet modern design  
- Color palette: **black & white** with subtle **yellow accents**  
- Bold typography for a clean, professional look  
- Fully responsive design  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – entire structure written by me  
- **CSS3** – complete styling done by hand  
- **JavaScript** – I used some AI assistance, but I made sure to understand and learn from the code  

JavaScript is still a big chapter I’m working on, but I’m excited to improve and spend the coming months mastering it.  

## 🙌 Motivation

I’m proud that I was able to program this portfolio.  
It’s my **first step into the world of web development** and the project I’ll be using to apply for **internships** and **job opportunities**.  

This portfolio reflects who I am – how I build, how I think, and the style I prefer.
